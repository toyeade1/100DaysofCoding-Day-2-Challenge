# 100DaysofCoding-Day-2-Challenge

This challenge including using some math in order to find the percentage increase when a tip is added to a meal. The goal for the program was to generate a tip calculator that calculates each individuals payment once the initial pay, the amount of people spliting the bill, and the tip percentage is factored in.

Upon looking at the code further, I do see the opportunity to add a conditional statement to only allow the percentages 10, 12 or 15 as that is what the question stated. I could either use an if statement or use the try/except statements for this but for now will do what the question asked.
